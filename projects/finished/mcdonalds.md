# the mcdonald's sage

Every so often (a few times per year), the fast food chain McDonald's releases a simple game to play and win some prizes. These games are a copy of an existing game with a McDonald's twist.
And almost every time I try to program a bot to beat the game. This isn't so much for the prices, but more for the challenge.
